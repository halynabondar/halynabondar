### Hey! Welcome to my page! 👋

## I'm Halyna Bondar, </br> a Fullstack Developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark 🇩🇰

- 📝 I’m a frontend-focused full-stack developer with over 10 years of experience as a layout designer, bringing a sharp eye for detail, design consistency, and user experience to everything I build. While I enjoy working across the full stack, my true passion lies in frontend development — crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. Currently, I’m gaining real-world experience as a full-stack developer intern, working with modern frontend and backend technologies within the JavaScript ecosystem. I’m a responsible, fast learner with a strong drive for continuous improvement and delivering high-quality results. I also completed a full-stack web development bootcamp, which provided a solid foundation for my current role and ongoing growth in the tech industry.
