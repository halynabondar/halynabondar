### Hey! Welcome to my page! 👋

## I'm Halyna Bondar, </br> a Frontend Developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark 🇩🇰

- 📝 I have a strong passion for learning and personal growth. With over 10 years of experience as a layout designer, I have a sharp eye for detail and design, which I bring to my development work. I’m a responsible, fast learner who thrives in dynamic environments. Recently, I completed an intensive 8-month full-stack web development bootcamp, where I gained experience in both frontend and backend technologies. Now, I’m excited to continue honing my skills, building engaging user experiences, and contributing to impactful projects.
